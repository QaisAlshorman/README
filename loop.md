## [Loops and iteration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration)

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly

There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.

The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.

The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:

1. for statement
2. do...while statement
3. while statement
4. labeled statement
5. break statement
6. continue statement
7. for...in statement
8. for...of statement

## [Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)
JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

1. Assignment operators
2. Comparison operators
3. Arithmetic operators
4. Bitwise operators
5. Logical operators
6. String operators
7. Conditional (ternary) operator
8. Comma operator
9. Unary operators
10. Relational operators

JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator.
